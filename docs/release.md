# Release

Releases run through `.github/workflows/nodejs.yml` on a Git tag.

Before tagging:

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run lint
npm run test:gaps
npm run pack
```

Then create and push the version tag according to `/docs/skills/release.md`. The workflow installs dependencies, repeats all validation gates, and publishes the package with npm provenance. Publishing requires the repository's `NPM_TOKEN` secret and occurs only for pushed `v*` version tags.
